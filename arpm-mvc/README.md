The ARPM take home assignement.

## Installation

To install and run the project do the follow:
```
git clone https://github.com/aryan-arabshahi/arpm.git
cd arpm/arpm-mvc
docker compose up -d
```

## Project Structure

The project has been implemented in MVC architecture. There are 4 main files to follow:
- public/index.php
- routes/route.php
- views/view.php
- app/Controllers/PageController.php

I considered that there is no need to use the composer and autoload, so I required all the classes manually instead of generating the autoload.
